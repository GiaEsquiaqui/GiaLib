# GiaLib
Hello everybody! This repository have some of my basic c++ programs arranged in small libraries. 
The libraries are organized by the type of the programs that are stored in them.
Also, you may notice that the programs's names are in spanish, I'm sorry with the ones that do not understand spanish, it's my natal language after all and I'm used to programming using it.
Now, as you will see, for each library you'll find two files with "the same" name: the .cpp and the .h, remember that if you want to use any of them you need to have both files in the same c++ project an #include de .h file in the "main.cpp" file.
If you have any problems you can ask me and I'll do what is in my hands to help you!

~Gia.
